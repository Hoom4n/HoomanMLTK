# HoomanMLTK

**HoomanMLTK** (Machine Learning ToolKit) is a personal machine learning toolkit that provides modular, reusable components for a variety of ML workflows.  
This project is designed to centralize helpful utilities and abstractions developed during experimentation, prototyping, or production-level ML work.

## Modules

| **Domain** | **Tool / Class**     | **Description** |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `nlp`      | `TextPreprocessor`    | A powerful and flexible text preprocessing class built on top of **NLTK**, **TextBlob**, **re**, and **contractions**. It supports a wide range of text transformation tasks, including URL removal, contraction expansion, punctuation removal, spell checking, stemming, and lemmatization. Key features include: |
|            |                      | - **URL Removal**: Removes URLs to clean up the text. |
|            |                      | - **Contraction Expansion**: Expands common contractions (e.g., "don't" â†’ "do not"). |
|            |                      | - **Punctuation Removal**: Strips punctuation to reduce noise. |
|            |                      | - **Spell Checking**: Corrects spelling errors with **TextBlob**. |
|            |                      | - **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base forms using **NLTK**'s stemmers and lemmatizers. |
|            |                      | - **Parallel Processing**: Accelerates text transformations on large datasets. |
|            |                      | - **Customizable Options**: Apply only the transformations you need. |
|            |                      | - **Flexible Output**: Return preprocessed text as a string or a list of tokens. |

## Quick Start

```python
from hoomanmltk.nlp import TextPreprocessor

texts = ["if i ever were to lose you" , "Take me on" , "Take on me"]

processor = TextPreprocessor(
    url_remove=True,
    expand_contractions=True,
    remove_punctuation=True,
    lemmatize=True,
    output_mode="text"
)

cleaned = processor.fit_transform(texts)
print(cleaned)
```
